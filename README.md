# Keyboard Bullshit/Buzzword Generator API

Keyboard bullshit is the icing on the cake, proof that not even the keyboard world takes the keyboard world seriously. People get annoyed about it but don’t do anything about it, they give its use in forums the dignity of a response rather than someone saying “what the fuck are you talking about?!” Even Googling “how to deal with keyboard bullshit” renders no exact matches and very related matches.

So, I made this lovely little keyboard bullshit generator to randomly pick out phrases, which can help your product get ahead in an industry where spin, buzzwords and vagueness reign supreme.

## `GET https://keyboard-bs-generator-api.pngu.workers.dev/`

It will sound so good that geekhack users will just nod enthusiastically even though they have no idea. To add a `/bullshit` command to your discord server (for reasons), you can use [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=878990001046700042&scope=applications.commands).

## Few bullshit examples

### 1) Product Designers could distinctively extend standards compliant Deskmats

`Means: “Skip color matching and prototyping on $5 rubber mats you retail for $50”`

### 2) Keyset "Designers" will finally pursue tasteful Stock Colors

`Means: “Make the 4th N9/L9 set of the year” or “use 3 out of 20 vendor-defined colors and complain about similar sets”`

### 3) Keebtalkers will fungibly thock tactile Thocks

`I'm not sure what the hell this is supposed to mean either`

## Other Notes
